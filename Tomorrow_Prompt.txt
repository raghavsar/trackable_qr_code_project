I need help building a focused dynamic QR code tracking service with the following microservices architecture:

Core Architecture:
- Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- API Gateway (FastAPI)
- Essential Microservices:
  * User Service (Basic Authentication)
  * VCard Service (Simple Business Card)
  * QR Service (QR Generation)
  * Analytics Service (Basic Tracking)
  * Redirect Service (URL Handling)

Technical Stack:
- MongoDB for primary data storage
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Docker for containerization
- FastAPI for backend services
- React for frontend

Core Requirements:

1. VCard Service:
- Basic business card creation/editing
- Simple template system
- Store contact information

2. QR Service:
- Generate QR codes for VCards
- Basic customization (size, color)
- Link QR codes to analytics

3. Analytics Service:
- Track QR code scans
- Basic metrics (scan count, timestamp)
- Simple geographic data

4. Redirect Service:
- Handle QR code redirects
- Track redirect events
- Basic URL management

5. User Service:
- Simple authentication
- Basic user management
- Role-based access

Essential Features:
- CRUD operations for VCards
- QR code generation and tracking
- Basic analytics dashboard
- Simple user management
- Docker containerization

Focus Areas:
1. Service communication patterns
2. Basic error handling
3. Simple monitoring
4. Essential security measures
5. Basic deployment setup

Please provide:
1. Service-by-service implementation guide
2. Core API endpoints for each service
3. Basic data models
4. Essential Docker setup
5. Simple deployment instructions

Exclude for now:
- Complex customization features
- Advanced analytics
- Bulk operations
- Complex security measures
- Advanced monitoring


I'll help you create a step-by-step plan to set up the entire project. Let's break it down into manageable phases:

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Infrastructure

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Already done:
   ✓ Python virtual environment (.venv)
   ✓ Basic project structure
   ```

2. **Docker Infrastructure**
Let's verify the docker-compose configuration:

Read file: docker-compose.yml


Here's our implementation plan:

### Phase 1: Core Services Setup (1-2 days)
1. **Set up MongoDB Service**
   - ✓ MongoDB configuration in docker-compose.yml
   - Create initial database schemas
   - Set up authentication

2. **API Gateway Service** (Port 8000)
   - Set up FastAPI application
   - Configure routing
   - Implement authentication middleware
   - Set up CORS

3. **User Service** (Port 8001)
   - Implement user models
   - Create authentication endpoints
   - Set up JWT handling
   - User CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Business Logic Services (2-3 days)
4. **VCard Service** (Port 8002)
   - Implement vCard models
   - Create CRUD endpoints
   - Set up data validation
   - Implement business logic

5. **QR Service** (Port 8003)
   - Set up QR code generation
   - Implement storage solution
   - Create API endpoints
   - Handle image processing

### Phase 3: Supporting Services (2-3 days)
6. **Analytics Service** (Port 8004)
   - Set up data collection
   - Implement tracking logic
   - Create reporting endpoints
   - Set up data aggregation

7. **Redirect Service** (Port 8005)
   - Implement scan handling
   - Set up redirect logic
   - Create tracking integration
   - Handle error cases

### Phase 4: Frontend Development (3-4 days)
8. **React Frontend**
   - Set up project structure
   - Implement authentication
   - Create vCard management UI
   - Build analytics dashboard
   - Implement QR code handling

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (2-3 days)
9. **Integration**
   - Connect all services
   - Set up end-to-end testing
   - Implement monitoring
   - Add logging

10. **Deployment Preparation**
    - Finalize Docker configurations
    - Set up CI/CD
    - Prepare deployment scripts
    - Document deployment process

Would you like to start with Phase 1? We can begin by:
1. Setting up the MongoDB service
2. Implementing the API Gateway
3. Creating the User Service

Which would you prefer to tackle first?
